* TASKS
** TODO make it more ergonomic
   - ban all single-hand command sequences, every complex command should use both hands _alternately_
   - don't bind (q a z p ; / [ ] ' shift ctrl) to minimize usage of pinkies
   - forget about mnemonics, it's not a problem with which-key
   - use _space_ as a mod-key

** TODO find or write a better key engine
   - implement several navigation modes, including text object navigation
   - switching betwen text objects should be efficient and fast
   - there should be a dedicated key for entering text-object-mode for every type of text object.

** TODO get rid of annoying quirks
   - map russian characters
   - map capital charactes (?)
